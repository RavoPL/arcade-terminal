# Arcade Terminal
Developed by **Dorian Wolarz**, a Code Institute Student

*Arcade Terminal is a Python game which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on the Heroku webpage. Users can play the classic game of Snake, where they maneuver the end of a growing line in order to collect and consume apples, all while avoiding game-ending collisions.*
