# Arcade Terminal
Developed by **Dorian Wolarz**, a Code Institute Student

*Arcade Terminal is a Python game which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on the Heroku webpage. Users can play the classic game of Snake, where they maneuver the end of a growing line in order to collect and consume apples, all while avoiding game-ending collisions.*

## How to Play

Arcade Terminal is based on the classic game of Snake, which originated in 1976 in the arcade game *'Blockade'*.

The player uses his arrow keys to move the titular Snake around the board.

If the Snake finds an apple, it eats it and grows larger by one segment.

The game ends when the Snake collides with the edge of the terminal screen or with its own tail.

The goal of the game is to make the Snake as large as possible before that happens.
